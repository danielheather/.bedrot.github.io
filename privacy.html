  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: May 28, 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    Bedrot (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Bedrot app (the “<strong>Service</strong>”). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> As of now, Bedrot does <em>not</em> collect or transmit any personal data or usage data to external servers. All information remains on your device and is used only to power the app’s features. If our approach changes—such as adding encrypted backend storage or third-party analytics—this policy will be updated and you will be notified.
  </p>

  <h2>Collecting and Using Your Data</h2>

  <h3>Usage Data (On-Device Only)</h3>
  <p>
    Bedrot uses Apple’s <strong>DeviceActivity</strong> and <strong>Family Controls</strong> frameworks to track screen-time usage and app activity. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which apps are open and for how long.</li>
    <li>Screen time across the device.</li>
    <li>Notifications for time-sensitive and family-enabled features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>All data remains on the user’s device.</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit this data to any server or third party. Usage Data is used solely to power the app’s time-management and parental-controls features.
  </p>

  <h3>Personal Data</h3>
  <p>
    Bedrot does not request or store any Personal Data beyond what is needed for core functionality. Specifically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require or collect your name, email address, or account information.</li>
    <li>We do not share any data with third-party analytics or advertising providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Data by Bedrot</h2>
  <p>
    We use the on-device Usage Data for these purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time Tracking:</strong> To measure how much time is spent in apps, helping you build healthier routines.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To deliver time-sensitive alerts (e.g., “You’ve spent X minutes on social media today”).</li>
    <li><strong>Family Controls:</strong> If you enable Family Controls in Screen Time, Bedrot can help a guardian monitor a child’s usage. All of these controls and data are managed locally on the device or via Apple’s Screen Time infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>No data is sent to any external servers or third parties.</em> It all stays on your device or within Apple’s ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Since we do not transmit or store data externally, we do not share your Usage Data or Personal Data with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Service providers (no third-party analytics, no crash reporting services).</li>
    <li>Affiliates or business partners.</li>
    <li>Advertising or marketing networks.</li>
    <li>Any other external entities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention of Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    Bedrot retains Usage Data only for as long as necessary to provide features in the app. When you delete Bedrot or reset its data in Settings, all usage data is removed from your device. We do not store any data server-side.
  </p>

  <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to secure Usage Data on your device, but no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our Service is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect or track data for any child under 13 without parental consent. If you become aware that a user under 13 is using Bedrot without parental consent, please contact us so we can remove that data.
  </p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>
    Bedrot may include links to third-party websites or resources (for example, support documentation). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Be sure to review their privacy policies when you leave our app.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any changes are significant, we will notify you via a prominent notice in the app and update the “Last updated” date above.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are advised to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your data.
